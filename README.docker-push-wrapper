docker-push-wrapper is a wrapper which turns docker push into a NOP

This is usefull for testing end-to-end, where you don't want your images
to end up at the repository, but you don't want to alter the build jobs.

This is built by:
make update_docker_wrapper

and for the extra_jobs:
make update_extra_jobs_docker_wrapper

And if ju just want it all, as quickly as possible:
make -j all_extra_job_docker_wrapper
